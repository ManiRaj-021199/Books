Password Strength Indicator:

    Create a program that determines the complexity of a given
    password based on these rules:
        • A very weak password contains only numbers and is
        fewer than eight characters.
        • A weak password contains only letters and is fewerthan
        eight characters.
        • A strong password contains letters and at least one
        number and is at least eight characters.
        • A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and
        special characters and is at least eight characters.


    Example Output:

        The password '12345' is a very weak password.
        The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
        The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
        The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
