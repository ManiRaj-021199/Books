In this lab you will create two subclasses: 
    - SadObject
    - HappyObject
    
    Both subclasses should override getMood() in order to supply their own specially tailored mood.
        
        * SadObject and HappyObject should also add some methods of their own. 
            - SadObject should add a method: public void cry(). 
            - HappyObject should add a method: public void laugh(). 
    
        * laugh() should write “hahaha” to the command line.
        * cry() should write “boo hoo” to the command line.
