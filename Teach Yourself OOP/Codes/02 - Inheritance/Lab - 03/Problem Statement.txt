Problem Statement:

    Your task is to formulate an inheritance hierarchy and implement the accounts. 
        
        You must create the following account classes:
            - BankAccount
            - SavingsAccount
            - TimeMaturityAccount
            - CheckingAccount
            - OverdraftAccount
        
            BankAccount is the base class => It contains those tasks common to all accounts. 
            That is the only hierarchical hint that you will get! 

        There are a number of simplifications that you can make. 
            - For fees
            - timed maturity
            - interest calculations
        
            assume that some third party will watch the calendar. 
            Donâ€™t program that kind of functionality into your classes. 
            Instead, provide a method for another Object to call. 
            
            For example, the SavingsAccount should have an addInterest() method.
            An outside object will call that method when it is time to calculate interest. 
            Likewise, the CheckingAccount should expose an accessFees() method. 
            When called this method will calculate any fees and apply them against the balance.
