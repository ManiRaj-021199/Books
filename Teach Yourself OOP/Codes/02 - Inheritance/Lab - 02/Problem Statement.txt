In Lab 1 you created a MoodyObject class. 
    - All of the subclasses redefine getMood(). 

For Lab 2, change that hierarchy a bit. 
    - Make the getMood() method abstract. 
    - update the MoodyDriver so that it no longer attempts to directly instantiate MoodyObject. 
    - You wonâ€™t have to make any changes to SadObject or HappyObject. 
        - since they already provide an implementation of getMood().
