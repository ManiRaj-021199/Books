Problem Statement:
    
    * Use the poker card description design classes to represent the cards, 
        - the deck of cards,
        - the dealer 
    * You should then write a small main() that instantiates 
        - the dealer
        - your deck of cards 
        - shuffles the cards
        - prints out the deck

When thinking about the classes that you will create, be sure to consider implementation hiding and division of responsibility.
