Problem Statement:

    # Teller is a Main Class
    # The Teller expects a specific public interface. Here are the rules:

        * You must name the account class Account

        * The class must have the following two constructors:
            => public Account()
            => public Account( double initial_deposit )
            The noargs constructor will set the initial balance to 0.00. The second constructorwill set the initial balance to initial_deposit

        * The class must have the following three methods. 
            - The first method credits the account with the value of funds:
                => public void depositFunds( double funds )

            - The next method debits the account by the value of funds:
                => public double withdrawFunds( double funds )
                However, withdrawFunds() should not allow an overdraft. Instead, if funds is greater than the balance, only debit the remainder of the balance. withdrawFunds() should return the actual amount withdrawn from the account.

            - The third method retrieves the accountâ€™s current balance:
                => public double getBalance()
