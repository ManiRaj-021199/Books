Paint Calculator

    Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.

    Example Output
        You will need to purchase 2 gallons of
        paint to cover 360 square feet.
        Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
        round up to the next whole gallon.
